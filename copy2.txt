The diagram illustrates the process of generating electricity. It also illustrates how rain is made as the first step of the process, whereas the final step involves the consumtion of electricity in people’lives.
Firstly, water from the sea eveporates due to the heat from the sun and then it gathers to shape clouds. When clouds contain a considerably amount of water, rain falls down. At this stage, water from reservoir flows through the dam and the valve is turned from close to open. After flowing through the turbine and make it rolls. Water then continues going through a pipe to a pump. Afterwhich, water is pumped in order to return to the reservoir. This process is repeated as a circle and this is how hydro-power are gerenated and ready to the next steps.
Hydro electricity is transferred from a antenna put on the turbin house to high voltare cables before going to a transformer station. Finally, station provides electricity to citizens’houses as well as for public facilities such as hospitals and schools through underground cables. Besides, generated electricity is also widely used in companies and factories for industrial and business purposes.
